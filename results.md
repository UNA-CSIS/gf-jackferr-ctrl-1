## What I learned...
- While I already have a strong foundation in Github, it is always good to brush up on best practices
- Firstly, always provide strong documentation for pull requests and never ever force push anything into master/main, always take the time to look over changes to ensure quality and prevent errors
- Leverage Issues for things in process and potential bugs and improvements, this allows the entire team to be on the same page and everyone knows what direction go in.
